# Meet Marine Cytometry Inc.

Marine Cytometry Inc. (MarCy) was born to create an analytical flow cytometer for the study of phytoplankton when the 
state-of-art wasn't enough.

The organisms that fuel the aquatic food chain are tiny; in the size range of light's wavelength. 
Their scatter and polarization signals strongly vary with the angle of observation. 
Furthermore, the light-harvesting pigment complexes use efficient, non-linear, energy transfer mechanisms. 
Documentation of those properties requires instruments that measure the wavelength-dependent, angular distribution of very dim signals.

Plankton identification requires the correlation of optical properties with single-cell manipulation and DNA analysis. 
The equipment needs to be flexible, precise, and robust so that it can withstand the rough conditions of work at sea.

# The MarLux&trade;

The MarLux&trade; implements cutting-edge technologies that provide an unparalleled level of flexibility, 
precision, and robustness.

## Dark Field Flow Cytometry

The MarLux&trade;, uses an off-axis illumination geometry that presents particle scatter against a dark background. 
The laser reflections that bounce inside the jet and optics are directed away from the detector field[^1]. 

Dark Field illumination allows the registration of particles as small as 1/2 the illumination wavelength, 
well above background noise.

## Omni-Directional Flow Cytometry&trade;

Since the illumination and registration optics are not in the same plane, they can be oriented at any angle[^2]. 
To detect color changes associated with energy transfer, the angular distribution of the polarization state can be determined. 
The instrument can also be equipped for full spectral analysis.

Many lasers and detectors can be setup at arbitrary orientations.
This allows for unique experiments that can't be performed on any other machine.

### Examples of Angular Experiments

![Examples of angular experiments](/images/angular_experiments.png)

## Controlled Environment Sorting

Many marine organisms are adapted to an oxygen-free environment. 
The MarLux&trade; allows live sorting in a controlled atmosphere.

## Real-Time Multi-Parameter Classification

MarCy's data acquisition system correlates particle properties with environmental conditions. 
Photopigment expression strongly depends on ambient light. 
The local temperature and salinity of seawater holds information about sea currents and upwelling.

Particle sorting based on anisotropic fluorescence signatures may require a combination of multiple angular signals. 
The MarCy data bus executes high-speed custom algorithms for sort classification.

### Pigment Chain Analysis

![Pigment Chain Analysis](/images/pigment_chain_analysis.png)

Multi-laser, single-pigment action spectra can be displayed as "needles" and as ratios of four excitation wavelengths.
Sorting on calculated properties requires consistent real-time signal processing.
The MarCy bus accepts __user programmable FPGAs__ that perform data calculations for event classification on multiple event parameters.

MarCy's novel flow technology offers advantages for yet untested fields. 
We are actively exploring novel applications with leading scientists and have participated in field trials off the 
West coast of South America, over the Atacama trench, the tropics at Hawaii and Bermuda and the Arctic.

[Let us know](@/contact.md) if you have a small-particle application that might profit from MarCy's __Omni-Directional&trade; Approach__.
