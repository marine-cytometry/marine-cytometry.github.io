# Meet Marine Cytometry Inc.

Marine Cytometry Inc. (MarCy) was born to create an analytical flow cytometer for the study of phytoplankton when the 
state-of-art wasn't enough.

The small organisms that fuel the aquatic food chain are in the size-range of the wavelength of light (Mie theory).
The scatter and polarization of signals from such small particles vary with the direction of observation. 
Furthermore, the light-harvesting pigment complexes make use of efficient, non-linear, energy transfer mechanisms.
Documentation of anisotropic optical phenomena requires instruments capable of measuring the wavelength-dependent, 
angular distribution of very dim signals.

Plankton identification requires the correlation of optical properties with single-cell manipulation and DNA analysis. 
The equipment needs to be flexible, precise, and robust so that it can withstand the rough conditions of work at sea.

# The MarLux&trade;

The MarLux&trade; implements cutting-edge technologies that provide an unparalleled level of flexibility, 
precision, and robustness.

## Dark Field Flow Cytometry

The MarLux&trade;, uses a unique off-axis illumination geometry that presents particle scatter against a dark background. 
Laser reflections that bounce inside the jet and optical elements are directed away from the detector field[^1].

![Symmetric Signal Detection](/images/symmetric_signal_detection.png)

Dark Field illumination allows the detection of particles as small as 1/2 the illumination wavelength
well above background noise.

## Omni-Directional Flow Cytometry&trade;

Since the illumination and registration optics are not in the same plane, they can be oriented at any angle[^1]. 
To detect color changes associated with energy transfer, the angular distribution of the polarization state
can be determined. 
The instrument can also be equipped for full spectral analysis.

The MarLux™ cell sorter incorporates Dark Field illumination in a circular layout. 
This geometry allows multiple excitation and emission channels (up to five each) at user-selectable angles. 
Because of its flexibility and low background noise, the MarLux is well suited to investigating particles whose 
properties fall in the Mie scatter domain.

### Examples of Angular Experiments

## Controlled Environment Sorting

Many marine organisms are adapted to an oxygen-free environment. 
The MarLux&trade; allows live sorting in a controlled atmosphere.

## Real-Time Multi-Parameter Classification

The MarLux™ Open Bus Protocol combines particle properties with environmental conditions. 
Ambient light controls photo-pigment expression. 
The local temperature and salinity of seawater hold information about sea currents and upwelling.

Particle sorting based on anisotropic fluorescence signatures may require a combination of multiple angular signals. 
The MarCy data bus executes high-speed custom algorithms for sort classification.

### Pigment Chain Analysis

![Pigment Chain Analysis](/images/pigment_chain_analysis.png)

Multi-laser, single-pigment action spectra can be displayed as "needles" and as ratios of four excitation wavelengths.
Sorting on calculated properties requires consistent real-time signal processing.
The MarCy bus accepts __user programmable FPGAs__ that perform data calculations for event classification on multiple event parameters.

MarCy's novel flow technology offers advantages beyond marine biology. 
The company actively explores novel applications with leading scientists. 
MarCy scientists have participated in field trials off the west coast of South America, over the Atacama trench, 
in the Arctic and in time series near Hawaii and Bermuda.
