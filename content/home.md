The marine food chain is supported by a network of tiny organisms. 
These microbes provide the energy and fix the organic carbon that are essential for larger creatures. 
Microbial primary producers are among the oldest, smallest, and most consequential life forms on earth. 
The most abundant among them are too small to observe directly with a microscope and have been first detected using flow cytometry.

Marine Cytometry Inc. (MarCy) develops appropriate flow cytometry equipment and methodology for studying marine microbial communities. 
The instruments combine a low background with high sensitivity. 
They have special features for complex multi-wavelength measurements. 
The instruments are compact and robust and are intended to be used at sea to be an integral component of multidisciplinary ocean surveys.
