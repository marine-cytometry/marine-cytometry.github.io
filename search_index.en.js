flow cytometers for the study of phytoplankton communities.\nThe organisms at the base of the aquatic food chain are very small: about the size of the wavelength of light.\nMie theory predicts that their scatter and polarization vary with the direction of observation and consequently cannot\nbe expressed in a single value.\nThe energy harvesting the pigment complexes make use of non-linear energy transfer mechanisms.\nDocumentation of anisotropic optical phenomena requires flow instruments that measure spectral and polarization signals\nat adjustable angles.\nCorrelating plankton identity with biological activity requires combining optical measurements with single-cell\nmanipulation and DNA analysis.\nThe sorting equipment needs to be flexible, accurate, robust, and PCR-clean, so that experiments can withstand the\nrough conditions of work at sea.\nThe MarLux™ Cell Sorter\n\nDark Field Flow Cytometry\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Symmetrical Signal Detection\n    \n    \n    A two-tier organization allows placement of illumination and detection channels at any angle.\n\n    \n    \n\nMarCy's cytometers utilize a unique off-axis illumination geometry that presents particle scatter against a dark\nbackground.\nLaser reflections that bounce inside the jet and optical elements are directed away from the detector field1.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Side Scatter\n    \n    \n    The MarLux detect 0.2 µm particles 2-3 decades above background.\n\n    \n    \n\nDark Field illumination allows the noise-free detection of particles as small as 1/2 the illumination wavelength.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Raw Images\n    \n    \n    Raw images without scatter bar or chromatic filters at λ = 450nm\n\n    \n    \n\nFull Spectrum Omni-Directional Flow Cytometry™\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Pseudo-nitzschia Multiseries\n    \n    \n    Fluorescence spectrum of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries.\n\n    \n    \n\nSince the illumination and registration optics are in different planes, they can be oriented at any angle1.\nIn order to detect color-changes associated with energy transfer, the angular distribution of the polarization state\ncan be determined.\nThe instrument can also be equipped for full spectrum analysis.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Examples of Angular Experiments\n    \n    \n    \n\nThe MarLux™ cell sorter incorporates Dark Field illumination in a circular layout.\nThis geometry allows multiple excitation and emission channels (up to 5 each) at user-selectable angles.\nBecause of its flexibility and low background noise, the MarLux is well suited to investigate particles whose properties\nfall in the Mie scatter domain.\nControlled Environment Sorting\nMany marine organisms are adapted to a low oxygen environment.\nMarCy's instruments allow live sorting in a controlled atmosphere.\nReal-Time Multi-Parameter Classification\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Prochlorococcus &amp; Synechococcus Vs Depth\n    \n    \n    \n\nThe MarLux™ Open Bus Protocol combines particle properties with environmental conditions.\nPhoto-pigment expression is controlled by ambient light.\nThe local temperature and salinity of seawater hold information about sea currents and upwelling.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Pigment Chain Analysis\n    \n    \n    Multi-laser, single-pigment action spectra can be displayed as needles and as ratios of four excitation\nwavelengths.\n\n    \n    \n\nParticle sorting based on anisotropic fluorescence signatures may require a combination of multiple angular signals.\nThe MarCy data bus executes high-speed custom algorithms in real-time.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    MarCy Bus\n    \n    \n    MarCy bus with user extensions\n\n    \n    \n\nSorting on calculated properties requires consistent real-time signal processing.\nThe MarCy bus accepts user programmable FPGAs that perform data calculations for event classification on multiple\nevent parameters.\n\nMarCy's novel flow technology offers advantages in small particle analysis beyond marine biology. \nThe company actively explores novel applications with leading scientists. \nMarCy scientists have participated in field trials off the west coast of South America, over the Atacama trench, in the\nArctic and in time series near Hawaii and Bermuda.\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\nContact us if you have a small-particle application that might
